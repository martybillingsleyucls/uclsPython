# Transposition Ciphers
In  a *transposition cipher*, all the same letters are used, but their positions are changed. The ciphertext is a permutation of the plaintext.  This type of cipher defeats frequency analysis attempts to decipher the message, as each letter is the same as in the plaintext message.

In *columnar transposition*, the message is written out in rows of fixed length and then read column by column. The key indicates the number of columns. To make it harder to crack, punctuation and spaces between words are usually removed. If the message doesnâ€™t fit the rows exactly, junk letters are added. 



**Example of Columnular Transpotion**<br>
Plaintext: `Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind.`<br>

Step 1: remove spaces and punctuation and make all letters lowercase:
`computersaregoodatfollowinginstructionsbutnotatreadingyourmind`



Step 2: rewrite the text into columns. In this case the row length is 5; this is the *key*<br>
`compu`<br>
`tersa`<br>
`regoo`<br>
`datfo`<br>
`llowi`<br>
`ngins`<br>
`truct`<br>
`ionsb`<br>
`utnot`<br>
`atrea`<br>
`dingy`<br>
`ourmi`<br>
`ndabc`<br>


Step 3: Read the text downwards to arrived at the encrypted text:<br>
`ctrdlntiuadonoeealgrottiudmrgtoiunnrnrapsofwncsoegmbuaooistbtayic`

### Write an Encryption Function
Write a function called encrypt() that takes a string and a key (an integer) and returns the string encrypted with a column cipher.

In the terminal (below, right) type `python trancipher.py` to run your program.

## Decrypting Columnular Transposition
To decrypt a message that has been enciphered using a columnular transposition, write the message going down the page, in columns. How long each column is (how many rows it has) can be determined by the length of the message divided by the key. (See, you need the key to decrypt the message!)
